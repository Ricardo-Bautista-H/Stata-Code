For the PC4 of Econometrics II, we were asked to replicate a paper, answer some questions and add a personal contribution. In this case the paper was “A panel data analysis of FDI and informal labor markets” from Antonio Baez (2014).
The challenging part about this was trying to recopilate all the datasets from different pages and sources, making the countries' names be the same and merge all into one database. Also, the cleaning of errors and treatment of missing values. A panel data model was used.
Each do. file refers to each specific part asked in the evaluation.
